<b>Monitoring the forest: </b>
	
	Monitoring does not mean only to look after physically. Monitoring should be done for safety and preventing harm. It also helps us to know what is going on in the forest in terms of the security of the trees and other illegal activities.

Presently it done in a manner of risking the lives of the people by going into the forest and record the flora. After doing this still the work is done only a 20%-30% and remaining forest is not accounted properly. Also in some parts of the world it is done by the satellites. Using satellite is ok for the bigger amount of land in which you want only the forest land covering as the images are not that clear that you can differentiate a tree. So in this we are using a drone/UAV to survey the forest more efficiently.

By using the drone we achieve following things
	<p>We can get all information of the trees and maintain the clear database.</p>
	<p>We can do biodiversity studies.</p>
	<p>Early recognition of the forest fires</p>
	<p>Protection of rare species and possibility of discovering new species</p>
	<p>There can be a study of how the climate is affecting forest.</p>
